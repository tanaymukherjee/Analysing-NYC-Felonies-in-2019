# Multivariate-Project for STA 9705
## Analysing NYC Felony Offenses in 2019
In this exercise we will apply many of the multivariate statistics techniques on NYC felony dataset for 2019 for all the boroughs and see if their any association between the features, and try to understand the data better using multivariate statistical methods

This is a team project as part of STA 9705 course which is a core-requisite for students in Statistics department for Baruch College, City University of New York.

### Introduction:
In accordance with New York State laws, the New York City Police Department reports reported crime and offense data. The law categories are summarized into three law categories: felony, misdemeanor and violation, which are further subdivided into broad crime and offense categories such as Murder, Rape, Robbery and etc. Please refer to NYPD website 1 for detailed info about the data collection.

### Data Dictionary:
In our project, we choose data of seven major felony offenses of five boroughs of New York City in 2019.

There are 77 observations with 8 variables including Precinct, reported incidents of Murder & Non Negl. Manslaughter, Rape, Robbery, Felony Assault, Grand Larceny and Grand Larceny of Motor Vehicle. We labeled boroughs as M= Manhattan, X = Bronx, K = Brooklyn, Q = Queens, S = Staten Island. Using this dataset, we conducted MAOVA analysis, Discriminant analysis, PCA and Factor analysis to evaluate the difference of five boroughs in terms of felony offenses.
